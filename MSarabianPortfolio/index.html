        	<p> My name is <span>Maryam</span>. I am a frontend developer passionate about JavaScript and JQuery.  I recently graduated from frontend web development course at GA. I got inspired by the course and I decided to pursue web development as a career. <p>
        	<p>  I have a bachelor's degree in Applied Math and a master's degree in Operations Research. My coding background went back to the time that I was at college. At that time I learned how to program in C and C++ and did some small projects at school. As a part of my master's thesis, I developed a <a class="link" href="http://thescipub.com/abstract/10.3844/jmssp.2010.157.162" target="blank"> Modified Genetic Algorithm </a> for solving the Bin Packing problem. In order to compare the results of my algorithm with other optimization methods, I coded my algorithm in C. Sounds like a lot of fun, huh?!</p>
      <p>I have around 3 years of working experience in software industry. I worked as a Software Quality Control Engineer in a small startup company in DC and learned about different testing techniques and basically how to break the software. Now it is time for me to learn how to build a software.</p>
      <p>My most recent experience was at 
      <a class="link" href="http://www.microstrategy.com/us/" target="blank"> MicroStrategy </a> 
      where I worked as a Tech Support Engineer in BI (Business Intelligence) field. 
      During past 3 years I realized that I am really interested in software development and I believe web development can be a good starting point for me.</p>
      <p> Are you ready to see my sample projects?</p>
