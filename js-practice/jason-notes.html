// Jason stands for Javascript Object Notation..
// Jason is a format for sharing data between client and server
// it is javascript based file
// it is a great alternative to xml
// it is easy to read.

we can easily parse the file ... using JASON.parse(data)

// unlinke javascript object, jason objcet can not have methods... keys are names.....they contain strings 

JASON has to be parsed into javascript... we can use eval function or JASON.parse for parsing the javascript.

Note: using eval can cause some security isues. using JASON.parse is more secure but it is less compatiable with older browsers.

JASON.stringift does the oppisity of parse.

a library like jquery can be helpful.

JASON will be more useful when reading data from another source.
