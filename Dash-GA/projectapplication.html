  <p>Hello GA!let me introduce myslef!</p>
  <br/> My name is Maryam.  I have a B.Sc in Applied Math and M.Sc in operations Research. My coding background went back to the time that I was doing my Bachelor. At that time I learned programming with C and C++. While I was doing my Master's thesis I came up with a modified Genetic Algorithm for solving the Bin Packing problem and to compare the result of my modified Genetic Algorithm with the other Optimization Methods I coded the new algorithm in C.  I have about 3 years working experience in computer science industry. I used to work as a Software Quality Control Engineer on a Banking software. My most recent position was Technical Support engineer in BI company called MicroStrategy. Since I am really interested about software development and mostly web development, I decided to leave my job to invest some time on enhancing my coding skill. I got interested in GA's web development immersive program and I hope I will be one of the GA's future student.
